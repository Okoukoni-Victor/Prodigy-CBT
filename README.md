## Case Study Summary

**Problem Statement:**  
Almost 8 in 10 people have experienced a crush — whether a celebrity, classmate, or someone spotted randomly on the way to buy bread and akara in your “no one would see me” outfit. The rush of attraction can be exciting, but the anxiety of not knowing where you and your crush stand can also “crush” you. Some people love the thrill of a crush without taking things further; they just want a way to fuel their imagination.

**FLAMES** is a fun, digital outlet for that curiosity. By bringing back the classic schoolyard game, it provides a lighthearted way to "calculate" your fate, squash overthinking, and turn nervous energy into a playful moment.

**Target Audience:**

- High school and university students
- Anyone “young at heart” who enjoys playful romantic curiosity
- Those who aren’t “too mature” to have fun with their crush

**Core Features:**

- Name-matching algorithm removes common letters between you and your crush
- Remaining count determines your destiny in one of six legendary states:

| Letter | State              | Description                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| F      | Friends            | Bestie Energy               |
| L      | Lovers             | Main Character Moment       |
| A      | Admirers           | Watching From Afar          |
| M      | Married            | Wedding Pinterest Activated |
| E      | Enemies            | Block and Move On           |
| S      | Sexual Partners 🙈 | Say Less                    |

## Styling Guide

**CSS Architecture**

The project uses a modular CSS structure:

• `base.css` → Design tokens, global resets, utility classes

• `components.css` → Section-level component styling

• `style.css` → Imports and bundles styles

This separation ensures:

• Scalability

• Clear responsibility boundaries

• Easier collaboration in a team setting

**Design Tokens (CSS Variables)**

All styling decisions are driven by centralized CSS variables defined in `:root` inside `base.css`.

**Color System**

The color system uses semantic tokens mapped to brand tokens:
```css
  --color-blush-red: #e94b6a;
  --color-cotton-candy-pink: #f7a8b8;
  --color-creamy-white: #fff5ec;
  --color-wine-red: #5a0f2e;
  --color-soft-peach: #ffe3dc;
```
These are mapped to semantic variables:
```css
  --action-primary
  --action-secondary
  --text-main
  --bg-body
  --bg-nav
```

**Why This Approach?**

• Prevents hard-coded colors

• Makes theme updates easy

• Improves consistency

• Encourages scalable design

**Typography System**

The project uses a clear typographic hierarchy:

• **Headings:** `Caveat` → expressive, playful tone

• **Body:** `Comfortaa` → rounded and friendly

Type scale variables:
```css
  --text-hero: 3.5rem;
  --text-section-heading: 2.5rem;
  --text-card-heading: 1.75rem;
  --text-base: 1rem;
  --text-small: 0.875rem;
```
This ensures:

• Visual consistency

• Clear hierarchy

• Maintainable scaling

**Spacing System**

Spacing follows a token-based scale:
```css
  --space-2: 0.5rem;
  --space-4: 0.875rem;
  --space-6: 1.5rem;
  --space-12: 3rem;
  --space-24: 6rem;
```
Benefits:

• Consistent rhythm across sections

• Avoids random spacing values

• Easy layout adjustments
